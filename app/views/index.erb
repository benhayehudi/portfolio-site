        <p>I have worked for nearly 10 years as a communal rabbi, non-profit professional and community organizer. During the past decade I've served communities and organizations in Boston, Denver, Chicago and New York. Throughout my non-profit career I've been fortunate to work closely with college students on campus, organize for a better society, teach adult education and create and lead new departments and teams.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After a decade of communal service, I've decided to shift my focus back to the tech sector. During the 1990s I co-founded and co-directed a San Diego, CA based computer security firm and co-founded Southern California's largest computer security conference. I've returned to my tech roots as a current student in the online immersive full stack web development program at the Flatiron School. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Please browse my coding portfolio and take a look at my blog posts, both my tech articles and my posts about society, non-profit leadership and Jewish communal life written over the years.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I look forward to being in touch!</p>
